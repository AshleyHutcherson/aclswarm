MATLAB Coder Generated C++ Library for ADMMGainDesign3D
=======================================================

The source code for this library was generated using MATLAB R2019b with MATLAB Coder 4.3. The test script used was `Benchmark.m`. This source code was generated from [the MATLAB code](https://github.com/mit-acl/aclswarm/tree/387c790ad576df6ecd361853008217cead7de70d/aclswarm/matlab) of commit 387c790ad.

## MATLAB Coder Settings

The settings used were essentially the defaults. However, for the cause of consistency, the settings are abbreiviated below.

- Numeric conversion: none (i.e., double precision)
- We used `Benchmark.m` automatically define input types.
    - One output
    - `Qs`: `double (3 x :inf)`
    - `adj`: `double (:inf x :inf)`
- We used `Benchmark.m` to exercise **ADMMGainDesign3D**
- Build type: Source code
- Output file name: ADMMGainDesign3D
- Language: C++
- Interface style: Functions
- Hardware Board: None - Select device below        *(shouldn't matter since not building via MATLAB)*
- Device: Generic ; 32-bit Embedded Processor       *(shouldn't matter since not building via MATLAB)*
- Toolchain: GNU gcc/g++ | gmake (64-bit Linux)     *(shouldn't matter since not building via MATLAB)*

## Testing

It is recommended that after updating this library you run the tests associated with `aclswarm`. This can be done by running `catkin run_tests --no-deps aclswarm`.
